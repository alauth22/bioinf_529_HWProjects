    "# BIOINF529 Homework #3 - Winter 2022\n",
    "This homework is worth **10% of your final grade**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam is due before the next course module begins as enforced by Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding by Contract\n",
    "We (the Instructors) promise a fair, impartial, and objective means of grading such that you (the Students) follow the tenets of Coding by Contract:\n",
    "1. You must not modify/delete any of the existing code in this document (besides the `pass` statements)\n",
    "* Your functions must use the function signatures as written\n",
    "* Your functions must return/print the expected results (as written)\n",
    "\n",
    "If these are followed correctly, your submission should be compatible with the automated testing suite. Therefore, the more tests your code passes, the less scrutiny your code will be under by our review. We do not care *how* you get there, just that you get there *correctly*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "Please rename this notebook to **homework3_uniqname.ipynb** for submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "> `homework3_apboyle.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will *only* grade the most recent submission of your exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Late Policy\n",
    "Each submission will receive a **25%** penalty per day (up to three days) that the assignment is late.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, the student will receive a **0** for the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Academic Honor Code\n",
    "You may consult with others. However, all answers must be your own and code comparison software will be used to enforce this rule. You are allowed to ask questions at office hours but the answers given will be high-level/conceptual in nature.\n"

    "### Baum-Welch\n",
    "In class we have now implemented aspects of evaluating a hidden Markov model through Viterbi and the Forward, Backward, and Forward-Backward algorithms. Each of these algorithms requires prior knowledge of dataset labels in order to generate the state inititaion, transition, and emission probabilities. You will now implement the Baum-Welch algorithm which will learn these probabilities for your model in an unsupervised manner. For this assignement, you may use any of the previously provided class implementations as part of your submission.\n",

    "### The Baum-Welch Algorithm\n",
    "The Baum-Welch algorithm, much like the other algorithms in the last few classes, consists of a series of steps: Initialization, Expectation, Maximization, and Termination. It is a type of Expectation-Maximization algorithm and so you will loop between the Expectation and Maximization steps until you reach convergence.\n",
